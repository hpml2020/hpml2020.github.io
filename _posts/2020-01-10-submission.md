### Submission

We invite authors to submit original work to HPML. All papers will be peer reviewed and accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.

Submissions must be in English, limited to 8 pages (including figures, tables and references) in the IEEE conference format (see <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" style="color:white">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a> )

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair website ( <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpml2020">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpml2020</a> ).

At least one author who has a paper accepted must register for the conference - IEEE / ACM CCGRID 2020 - and attend the workshop to present their paper. Authors who do not register and present their paper, or arrange for a knowledgeable colleague to present it, will not have their paper published.
