### May 11th, 2020, Melbourne - Australia.

#### Held in conjunction with <a href="http://cloudbus.org/ccgrid2020/">IEEE / ACM CCGRID 2020</a>

### Overview

This workshop is intended to bring together the Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High
Performance Computing (HPC) communities. In recent years, much progress has
been made in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. This progress
required heavy use of high performance computers and accelerators.
Moreover, ML and AI have become a "killer application" for HPC and, consequently,
driven much research in this area. These facts point to an important
cross-fertilization that this workshop intends to nourish.

We invite researchers and professionals to take part in this workshop to discuss
the challenges of Machine Learning, AI and HPC, and share their insights, use
cases, tools and best practices.

Proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore.
